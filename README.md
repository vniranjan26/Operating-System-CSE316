## Problem :
Considering 4 processes with the arrival time and the burst time requirement of the processes the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 3 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The schedulers then checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and considers the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler after the second iteration checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor and now provides the processor to the process with the least time requirement to go in the terminated state.
